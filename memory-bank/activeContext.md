## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Design Decisions
1. **Primary Color Scheme**: Using deep purples and blues to evoke night sky, with high contrast white/yellow accents for readability
2. **Default to Dark Mode**: Implemented as primary experience to match content theme and reduce eye strain
3. **Component Architecture**: Using composition pattern with shadcn/ui as foundation
4. **Image Strategy**: Optimizing high-quality night sky photography with Next.js Image component
5. **Event Cards**: Using consistent card design with clear visual hierarchy for event information
6. **Fallback Data**: Providing demo event data when Airtable credentials aren't available

### Technical Decisions
1. **Static Site Generation**: Using Next.js SSG for initial phase content
2. **Mobile-First Approach**: Designing for mobile devices first, then enhancing for larger screens
3. **Performance Focus**: Implementing lazy loading, code splitting, and image optimization
4. **Accessibility Standards**: Ensuring WCAG 2.1 AA compliance from the beginning
5. **Event Data Management**: Using Airtable as a simple CMS for event management instead of building custom admin interface
6. **Graceful Degradation**: Implementing fallback strategies for when external services are unavailable

### Open Questions
1. **Content Management**: Should we integrate a headless CMS in Phase 2 for easier content updates?
2. **Map Integration**: What's the best approach for light pollution mapping (Mapbox vs. custom SVG maps)?
3. **Community Features**: When should we implement user accounts and community features?
4. **Multilingual Support**: Should we plan for Swahili localization in Phase 1 or defer to later?
5. **Event Registration**: Should we integrate with a ticketing system for paid events?
