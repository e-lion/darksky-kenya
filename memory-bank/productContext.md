# DarkSky Kenya Product Context

## Problem Space

### Light Pollution in Kenya
Kenya possesses some of Africa's most spectacular night skies, but rapid urbanization and development are threatening these natural resources through increasing light pollution. The consequences include:

1. **Astronomy Impact**: Diminished visibility of stars, planets, and celestial phenomena
2. **Wildlife Disruption**: Interference with nocturnal species' behaviors, migration patterns, and lifecycles
3. **Tourism Reduction**: Decreased appeal for astro-tourism, a growing economic sector
4. **Cultural Erosion**: Loss of connection to traditional celestial navigation and star-based cultural traditions
5. **Health Concerns**: Human health impacts from disrupted circadian rhythms
6. **Energy Waste**: Unnecessary electricity consumption from inefficient lighting

### Awareness Gap
There is limited understanding about:
- The concept and causes of light pollution
- The wide-ranging impacts beyond astronomy
- Simple mitigation strategies accessible to individuals and communities
- The economic and environmental benefits of dark sky preservation

### Coordination Challenges
- Fragmented efforts across different organizations and regions
- Limited resources for advocacy and education
- Inconsistent policy approaches across counties
- Lack of centralized information and resources

## Solution Approach

### Platform Purpose
DarkSky Kenya serves as a comprehensive digital hub that:
1. **Centralizes Information**: Creating a single authoritative source for all dark sky preservation efforts in Kenya
2. **Bridges Knowledge Gaps**: Translating technical concepts into accessible information
3. **Enables Action**: Providing practical tools and resources for individuals and organizations
4. **Builds Community**: Connecting stakeholders across domains (astronomy, conservation, tourism, etc.)
5. **Influences Policy**: Supporting evidence-based advocacy with data and case studies

### User Experience Principles

#### For General Visitors
- **Enlightening**: Creates "aha moments" about the importance of dark skies
- **Accessible**: Presents complex information in understandable, compelling ways
- **Actionable**: Always connects information to possible actions
- **Inspiring**: Uses visual storytelling to create emotional connection

#### For Contributors and Partners
- **Empowering**: Provides resources that multiply their impact
- **Collaborative**: Enables sharing of knowledge and coordination of efforts
- **Recognition-oriented**: Highlights contributions and successes

#### For Researchers and Experts
- **Rigorous**: Maintains scientific accuracy while being accessible
- **Evidence-based**: Supports claims with proper citations and data
- **Comprehensive**: Covers the multidisciplinary nature of dark sky preservation

## Technical Approach

### Progressive Development
- Begin with core informational content and basic functionality
- Incrementally add interactive features based on user feedback
- Prioritize mobile optimization for rural accessibility
- Implement data-driven features in later phases

### Information Architecture
- Topic-based organization (astronomy, wildlife, tourism, etc.)
- User journey-based pathways (learn → engage → act)
- Resource repository with categorization and search
- Event and location mapping

### Visual Design Principles
- Clean, minimal interface that doesn't compete with stunning night sky imagery
- Dark mode as primary experience (appropriate for content and reduces eye strain)
- High contrast for readability in various lighting conditions
- Responsive layouts optimized for mobile devices with potentially low bandwidth
